# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a command the coder can create to communicate a task that needs to be done to the computer.

  Researched answer: A function is a set of statements that performs a task or can calculate values, however, a procedure to qualify as a function needs input first.



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: .map is a task that has the system run through an array and returns a result that is an array of the same length, but with the value of each index changed.   .filter takes said array, and returns the array with changes the user has declared in the form of a function or variable.  This array returns in a different length.

  Researched answer: .map creates a new array by transforming every element in an array, individually. .filter creates a new array and removes elements that don't belong. You can also add in more functions so these . methods to address what kind of result you want.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: Return gives the result of a function and can be used to display it on a browser, or page.  console.log is more specific to running a code and seeing it's results appear on a terminal, not displayed on a browser.

  Researched answer: console.log used for debugging in a console, return is used all over JavaScript to be able to use in a project.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: TDD tests your code to see if it works properly.  You must first test to see if your code fails in the proper area to make sure your TDD code works properly, and then you may run and test your official line of code that you were working on.
